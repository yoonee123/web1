<h2>Life Coding</h2>
<p>
Coding, sometimes called computer programming,
is how we communicate with computers.
Code tells a computer what actions to take,
and writing code is like creating a set of instructions.
By learning to write code,
you can tell computers what to do or how to behave in a much faster way.
You can use this skill to make websites and apps, process data,
and do lots of other cool things.
