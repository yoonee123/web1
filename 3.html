<p>First-person shooter (FPS) is a video game genre centered on gun
  and other weapon-based combat in a first-person perspective; that is,
  the player experiences the action through the eyes of the protagonist.
  The genre shares common traits with other shooter games,
  which in turn makes it fall under the heading action game.
  Since the genre's inception, advanced 3D and pseudo-3D graphics have challenged
  hardware development, and multiplayer gaming has been integral.
